Step 1: Prepare the Data
Store all your UIU-related PDFs in a folder (e.g., dataPacks).

Ensure they contain clean, readable content (skip scanned images unless OCR is applied).

Step 2: Load the PDFs
Use a PDF loader (like LangChain’s PyPDFLoader) to extract text from each PDF file.

Step 3: Chunk the Text
Split the extracted text into smaller chunks (e.g., 500–1000 characters) to make it suitable for embedding and retrieval.

Step 4: Generate Embeddings
Use an embedding model (like HuggingFace’s MiniLM or OpenAI embeddings) to convert each chunk into a vector.

Step 5: Store in Vector Database
Choose a vector store (like FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone, or Weaviate).

Add all the chunks and their embeddings to the vector database.

Step 6: Create a Retriever
Set up a retriever from the vector DB to fetch relevant chunks based on user questions.

Step 7: Set Up the Language Model
Choose and configure a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Claude, or a local LLM) to generate answers.

Step 8: Connect Retriever and LLM
Combine the retriever and the LLM into a RAG pipeline (using LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Haystack).

The retriever fetches relevant chunks, and the LLM uses them to generate accurate answers.

Step 9: Ask Questions
Provide natural language queries.

The RAG agent returns context-aware answers based on the embedded UIU PDFs.

Step 10: (Optional) Deploy the Agent
Use FastAPI, Streamlit, LangServe, or Gradio to create a web interface or API for users.
